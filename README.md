Game Pitch: In this traditional 2-D Platformer game, players must navigate a series of platforms and obstacles to reach the end of the level. Pop-ups and traditional UI elements become helpful tools that challenge playerâ€™s creativity and exploration skills. 

How to Play: Left and right arrow keys as well as space bar are used for movement and jump respectively. The player should explore the game themselves to figure out how to navigate the player to the end of the level.

Content Description: The game features two levels, with the first being of lower difficulty to introduce the player to the game, and the second being more difficult. We incorporate a few UI elements into the game that the player must either use or avoid to complete the levels. There are two types of pop ups that the player can interact with: smaller popups that can move but not be closed, these can be stood on and the player can use the cursor to drag them around a confined area to use as a platform, as well as larger popups that serve more as obstacles and that can be closed. These are visually distinguished by a white X in the corner, featured on the unclosable popups, and a red X in the corner, featured on the closable popups. The player can travel while on the popup, but the popup has no friction, which makes using the popups in this way intentionally slightly challenging. We also incorporate an unloaded image icon and a glitched loading image icon, which are functionally identical but visually different. They both respawn the player upon contact and serve as an obstacle to avoid. We also incorporate enemy with simplistic AI: they travel back and forth along their platform. This enemy uses a sprite similar to the dino in the game at chrome://dino that plays when there is no internet. 

Lessons Learned: The most valuable lesson we learned was of the critical importance of playtesting, especially from people who didn't make the game. We discussed this in class, but we understood to a greater depth after expriencing it. We had designed the game with intent, and when we tested the game we naturally played with that intent in mind. But having people playtest in class who didn't know what the designers wanted showed us all of the exploits and alternate ways that people could do things with the game in ways we liked and didn't like. This gave us the option to revise certain aspects embracing strategies that we liked, and to correct certain problems and exploits. We also learned that scope is important: it's easy to dream big but what's more important is cohesion and clarity. Having a game with too much going on, has complex mechanics, and isn't cohesive ruins the user experience and can nullify the reasons a player might want to play a game.
